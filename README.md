The visitors will be given the option to select both their skill and fitness levels, the site will collate the choices of each visitor, and return the best trail that suits the rider selections. 

The website has been designed to be responsive, intuitive and accessible on a range of devices, including smartphones, tablets and desktops/laptops.

## User Experience

East Sussex MTB Trails uses the visitor choices from the dropdown menus, and displays the mountain bike trail that suits the rider characteristics, along with its location (presented to the visitor in a map) and 3 bullet points showing key information about such trail.


## User stories

-  ### <h3>First Time Visitor Goals</h3>

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to find out which mountain bike trail I should be attempting to ride, based on my current level of skills and fitness. Once I know which trail is suitable for me, I want to make some notes of the key characteristics of such trail.
    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to plan directions to get to the location where the mountain bike trail is. 
    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to get in touch with the real people behind East Sussex MTB Trails, and ask some questions about a particular trail.

-  ### <h3>Returning Visitor Goals</h3>

    1. As a Returning Visitor, since my set of skills and fitness level might have changed from my first visit, I could be using this site to check out other trails to ride, and make some notes about the key characteristics of the new trail I would like to ride.
    2. As a Returning Visitor, I might want to plan directions to get to the location where any other trails are. 
    3. As a Returning Visitor, I would like to keep interacting with the owners of the site, by sending them an enquiry about anything in regards to the information displayed about the trail, location or key characteristics of it.

## Design

- ### <h3>Colour Scheme</h3>

I wanted to keep the design of the website simple and neat. I have applied a hero image to be the main background of the website, please see below:

<img src="assets/images/hero-image.jpg" width="600" height="400" />

I picked a combination of colours that I consider to be eye-catching, and that does not take the attention of the user away from the main goal of the website. 

<img src="assets/images/colours.jpg" width="600" height="400" />

There are 2 dominant colours that can be identified on my site:

- <strong>Black galvanised (rgb(26, 23, 23))</strong> : Used as the background colour for the header, footer and the drop down menus as well as the result box (where the trail is revealed once the user has made their choices).
- <strong>Intense Orange (#ff3b00eb)</strong> : Used as the colour of the text displayed on the header, footer and the drop down menus as well as the result box (where the trail is revealed once the user has made their choices).

- ### <h3>Typography</h3>

The font I used for all the website is "Space Grotesk".

<img src="assets/images/font.PNG" width="1000" height="150" />

- ### <h3>Imagery</h3>

All the images I used for my project can be found in the following [link](assets/images) 

I used the site [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) to download all my images, with the exception of the ones corresponding to the mountain bike trails I have based my website on. I acquired those one via facebook groups where I am a member of.

## Wireframes

All the wireframes I drew can be found in the following [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I5aTeuauP6dX7BXcyk2UEwv-AodJriGK/view?usp=sharing)
